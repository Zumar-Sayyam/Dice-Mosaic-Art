# 🎲 Dice Mosaic Art

*A Python project that transforms any image into a stunning dice-based mosaic!*

Built with 🐍 **Python**, 🎨 **Pillow**, and 🚀 **Streamlit**

---

## ✨ Features

*  Convert any image into a **dice mosaic**
*  Adjustable dice size (**5 to 30 pixels**)
*  Choose between **grayscale or colorful** mode
*  Live preview with **Streamlit** web app
*  Simple, interactive interface for creative image transformation

## 🖼️ How It Works

The app analyzes the **brightness or color intensity** of each pixel in the uploaded image and maps it to a corresponding **dice face image (1–6)**.
This creates a fun and artistic visual made entirely out of dice!

> 🎯 Example: Darker area → dice face 6, lighter area → dice face 1
